This is a binary file. You'll need to create a cartoon-style map of Pune similar to the Scotland Yard map style. The map should include:

1. Major roads in white/beige color
2. Buildings in brown/orange tones
3. Green areas for parks and hills
4. Blue areas for rivers (Mula-Mutha)
5. Important landmarks highlighted
6. Clear paths for movement nodes

The map should be 1600x900 pixels in size.
